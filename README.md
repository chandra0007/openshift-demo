# Red Hat OpenShift - Demo

The purpose of this repository is to provide a set of simple proof-of-concept configuration scripts for OpenShift and various features on OpenShift on Power.

# Feature
1. [Topology Manager](topology_manager) aligns pod resources for optimal CPU, Memory, Device and other Topology placements in a cluster.


# Is this a Red Hat or IBM supported solution?

No. This is only a proof-of-concept that serves as a good starting point to understand how the various features works with OpenShift.
